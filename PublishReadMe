Kuda Published Content

Thank you for using the Kuda World Editor to publish your WebGL project! To make
your content available to others, you may use the provided html file which has
been packaged with *almost* everything it needs to be viewed on the web. If you
wish to embed your content into an existing html page, it only takes two steps:

- copy the script tags into the top of your html file
- copy the o3d div tag into your html file where you want the content to appear

load path. Depending on where you place this package in relation to your web
server's root directory, you may have to update these paths for them to load
properly.
